# Charts Community

Charts_community is a fork of [google/charts](https://github.com/google/charts)

This is necessary as Google is not currently accepting pull requests and there are bugs and features the community feels need to be added.

The current proposal is that the master branch of this repo will always be exactly the same as a commit on the master branch of google/charts and will be synchronized with the most current commit as soon as practical. The master branch will then be merged with our release and development branches ASAP. A new release will be created soon thereafter.

The version number of charts_community will follow Dartâ€™s [package versioning](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning) spec and the value will be the same as google/charts except the minor version field will be incremented by 1 and the patch field will be 0. This means that the charts_community public API will **always** be backwards compatible with google/charts but have new functionality or improvements as stated in [semver spec](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.1.html) rule 8.
